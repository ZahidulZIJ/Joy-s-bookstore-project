<b>Project Summary: Bookstore Inventory Management System</b>

Overview:
The Bookstore Inventory Management System is a web-based application designed to manage and track books within a bookstore. The interface allows users to view, search, add, update, and delete book records efficiently. It includes pagination to navigate through large datasets and provides quick access to essential book details.

Key Features:

    Book Listing:

        Displays a tabular list of books with columns for ID, Title, Author, ISBN, Stock, Price, and Actions.

        Each row represents a unique book entry in the inventory.

    Search Functionality:

        A search bar allows users to filter books by keywords such as title or author for quicker access to specific records.

    CRUD Operations:

        View: View full details of a book.

        Edit: Modify book details such as title, author, stock, or price.

        Delete: Remove a book from the system.

    Add New Book:

        A “New Book” button enables the addition of new entries into the inventory.

    Pagination:

        The table supports pagination, displaying 20 entries per page.

        Navigation controls allow users to move between pages easily, with current page highlighted.

User Interface:

    Clean and modern UI with a responsive design.

    Color-coded action buttons for clarity (e.g., green for “View”, blue for “Edit”, red for “Delete”).

    Data is well-organized in a readable tabular format.

Technology Stack (Assumed):

    Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, possibly React or another JS framework.

    Backend: Could be implemented with Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, or similar.

    Database: Likely uses a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store book data.

Use Cases:

    Bookstore managers maintaining inventory.

    Librarians cataloging and tracking book availability.

    Online book selling platforms managing product listings
